            We present a novel Factor Graph Diffusion Model (FG-DM) framework for modeling 
            the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables (such as segmentation, 
            depth, normal and sketch masks) for improved prompt consistency, high fidelity, and controllable image 
            synthesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recent advances in generative modeling with diffusion processes (DPs) enabled breakthroughs
            in image synthesis. Despite impressive image quality, these models have various prompt 
            compliance problems, including low recall in generating multiple objects, difficulty in 
            generating text in images, and meeting constraints like object locations and pose. For 
            fine-grained editing and manipulation, they also require fine-grained semantic or instance 
            maps that are tedious to produce manually. While prompt compliance can be enhanced by addition 
            of loss functions at inference, this is time consuming and does not scale to complex scenes.  
            To overcome these limitations, this work introduces FG-DMs that models the joint distribution 
            of images and conditioning variables, such as semantic, sketch, depth or normal maps via a 
            factor graph decomposition. This joint structure has several advantages, including support 
            for efficient sampling based prompt compliance schemes, which produce images of high object 
            recall, semi-automated fine-grained editing, explainability at intermediate levels, ability 
            to produce labeled datasets for the training of downstream models such as segmentation or 
            depth, training with missing data, and continual learning where new conditioning variables 
            can be added with minimal or no modifications to the existing structure. We propose an 
            implementation of FG-DMs by adapting a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model to implement 
            all FG-DM factors, using only COCO dataset, and show that it is effective in generating images 
            with 15\% higher recall than SD while retaining its generalization ability. We introduce an 
            attention distillation loss that encourages consistency among the attention maps of all 
            factors, improving the fidelity of the generated conditions and image. We also show that 
            training FG-DMs from scratch on MM-CelebA-HQ, Cityscapes, ADE20K, and COCO produce images of 
            high quality (FID) and diversity (LPIPS).

             it is effective in generating all visual conditions represented as RGB inputs while 
             retaining its generalization ability. To better adapt to the conditioning variables, 
             we introduce an attention distillation loss that improves the fidelity of the generated 
             conditions. It leverages the notion that the attention maps must be similar across 
             all the factors for a given input prompt. We also show that training FG-DMs from scratch 
             produce images of high quality (FID) and diversity (LPIPS) on multiple benchmark datasets 
             such as CelebA-HQ, ADE20K, Cityscapes and COCO. -->
            <!-- implement a factor graph of the conditioning variables in a sequential process 
            where the highest node corresponds to the image denoising Markov chain conditioned by 
            all or few of the conditioning variables in the lower levels of the graph. This joint 
            structure has several advantages, including ability to synthesize all conditioning 
            variables with/without user input, end-to-end training, support for detailed user 
            interaction and fine-grained editing, ability to produce labeled datasets for the 
            training of downstream models, training with missing data, and continual learning 
            where new conditioning variables can be added with minimal or no modifications to 
            the existing structure. To demonstrate this, two implementations of FG-DM are 
            introduced (i) training from scratch and (ii) adapting pretrained foundational model. 
            Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets such as CelebAMask-HQ, ADE20K, Cityscapes 
            and CoCo produce images of high quality (FID) and achieves state-of-the-art diversity 
            in terms of LPIPS metrics. -->

FG-DM models the joint distribution of an image and conditioning variables (e.g., segmentation, depth, normal, sketch or pose maps) which allows creative flexibility, editing controllability and faster attribute recall verification ability unlike the standard diffusion model pipeline.

                  FG-DM implemented for the distribution \(P(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}^1,  \mathbf{y}^2 | \mathbf{y}^3)\) of image \(\mathbf{x}\), segmentation mask \(\mathbf{y}^2\), and pose map \(\mathbf{y}^1\), given text prompt \(\mathbf{y}^3\). Each factor (conditional probability written at the top of each figure) is implemented by adapting a pretrained Stable Diffusion to generate the visual conditions. Note that the encoder-decoder pair and SD backbone is shared among all factors thereby reducing the total number of parameters of the model. Conditional generation chains are trained at a lower resolution for a better inference throughput.

                  Synthesized Segmentation/Depth/Sketch/Normal maps and the corresponding images by
FG-DMs adapted from SD using COCO dataset. FG-DMs generalize well to prompts beyond
the training dataset. Although the FG-DM is only trained to associate persons with black
 semantic maps segments, it also assigns the chimp, a class that it was not trained on, 
 to that color. This shows that the FG-DM can integrate the prior knowledge by SD that
  “chimps and persons are similar" into the
segmentation task. Conversely, the similarity between chimps and people might induce SD 
to synthesize a chimp in response to a prompt for people, or vice-versa. This is shown in the 
bottom left of the Figure where the FG-DM correctly synthesizes different colors for the chimp 
and the person, but the ControlNet fails. While the black box nature of SD makes these errors opaque,
 the FG-DM allows inspection of the intermediate conditions to understand these hallucinations. 
 This illustrates its benefits in terms of explainability.

              Each example depicts a pair $({\bf y},{\bf x})$ synthesized by the FG-DM of the joint $P({\bf x},{\bf y})$ in the top row. The condition map $\bf y$ was then manually edited as shown in the bottom row and the image $\bf x$ resynthesized using the factor $P({\bf x}|{\bf y})$. For the semantic map editing, we show the result of fusing two generated segmentation masks (second mask shown in the bottom right) using our semantic editing tool. The synthesized pose maps are also shown inside the generated images with segmentations.

              We have experimented with text-based editing of both real images and their segmentation masks using FGDM and LEDITS++ inversion. The top of Figure shown below refers to inversion of the segmentation mask.

              The bottom part of Figure below shows the comparison of LEDITS++ editing with inversion by SD and by the image synthesis factor of the FG-DM.

              Qualitative results for editing segmentation, depth and sketch maps to achieve desired spatial control, add new objects and generate text in images.
              Each example depicts a pair $({\bf y},{\bf x})$ synthesized by the FG-DM of the joint $P({\bf x},{\bf y})$ in the top row. The condition map $\bf y$ was then manually edited as shown in the bottom row and the image $\bf x$ resynthesized using the factor $P({\bf x}|{\bf y})$. For the semantic map editing, we show the result of fusing two generated segmentation masks (second mask shown in the bottom right) using our semantic editing tool. The synthesized pose maps are also shown inside the generated images with segmentations.

              In our experiments, we explored qualitative results for manipulating segmentation, depth, and sketch maps to achieve precise spatial control, resizing and adding new objects, and incorporating text into images. Each example is represented by a pair \((\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x})\), synthesized by the FG-DM of the joint \(P(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\), showcased in the top row.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              To demonstrate the editing capabilities, the condition map \(\mathbf{y}\) underwent manual adjustments, as illustrated in the bottom row. The resynthesis of the image \(\mathbf{x}\) was achieved using the conditional probability factor \(P(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y})\).

            <p>
              For semantic map editing, we present the results of fusing two generated segmentation masks (the synthesized second mask (airplane) is not shown here) using our specialized semantic editing tool. Additionally, the synthesized pose maps are shown beside the generated images, accompanied by their respective segmentations.

            There's a lot of excellent work that was introduced around the same time as ours.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09125">Progressive Encoding for Neural Optimization</a> introduces an idea similar to our windowed position encoding for coarse-to-fine optimization.
          </p>

            <a href="https://www.albertpumarola.com/research/D-NeRF/index.html">D-NeRF</a> and <a href="https://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/nonrigid_nerf/">NR-NeRF</a>
            both use deformation fields to model non-rigid scenes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some works model videos with a NeRF by directly modulating the density, such as <a href="https://video-nerf.github.io/">Video-NeRF</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~zl548/NSFF/">NSFF</a>, and <a href="https://neural-3d-video.github.io/">DyNeRF</a>
